# Decentralized Logistics Delivery Exception Management

A blockchain-based system for managing delivery exceptions in logistics operations, providing transparent tracking, accountability, and efficient resolution of delivery issues.

## Overview

This platform enables logistics stakeholders to:
- Verify and authenticate transportation carriers
- Register shipments with detailed delivery requirements
- Document exceptions when deliveries don't go as planned
- Track resolution processes to ensure accountability

## Core Smart Contracts

### 1. Carrier Verification Contract
- Validates legitimate transportation companies
- Manages carrier credentials and reputation scores
- Stores essential carrier information (licensing, insurance, capabilities)
- Creates a trusted network of verified logistics providers

### 2. Shipment Registration Contract
- Records detailed delivery requirements and specifications
- Captures origin, destination, timeframes, and special handling needs
- Establishes verifiable service level agreements (SLAs)
- Links shipments to verified carriers

### 3. Exception Documentation Contract
- Records delivery problems with timestamp verification
- Categorizes exception types (delays, damage, missing items, etc.)
- Captures evidence through hashed documentation
- Notifies relevant stakeholders of exceptions

### 4. Resolution Tracking Contract
- Manages corrective actions for documented exceptions
- Assigns responsibility for resolution tasks
- Tracks progress of remediation efforts
- Verifies when exceptions have been properly resolved
